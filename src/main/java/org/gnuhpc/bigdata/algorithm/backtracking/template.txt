Pick a starting point.
   while(Problem is not solved)
      For each path from the starting point.
         check if selected path is safe, if yes select it
         and make recursive call to rest of the problem
         If recursive calls returns true, 
           then return true.
         else 
           undo the current move and return false.
      End For
 If none of the move works out, return false, NO SOLUTON.
