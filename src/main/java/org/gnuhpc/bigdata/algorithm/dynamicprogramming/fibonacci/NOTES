it is technique to save intermediate results in a calculation in any comfortable format
so that the result can be used for further computation instead of calculating it all over again at the arrival of an additional input.

                         fib(5)
                     /             \
               fib(4)                fib(3)

         fib(3)      fib(2)         fib(2)    fib(1)
        /     \        /    \       /    \
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0) fib(1) fib(0)
  /    \
fib(1) fib(0)
We can see that the function fib(3) is being called 2 times.
If we would have stored the value of fib(3),
then instead of computing it again, we could have reused the old stored value.
There are following two different ways to store the values so that these values can be reused:
a) Memoization (Top Down)
b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)
